# Belly-Button-Challenge


This Challenge was an exercise in utilizing Javascript to read through data, create corresponding visualizations, and uploade them to a webpage. This was done by utilizing multiple functions, such as find() and filter(), as well as the D3 Javascript library. The data was filtered by sample ID, then used to create a bar graph, a bubble graph, and table of demographic information per each sample, as selected by the dropDownMenu we programmed in. When a different sample ID is selected, all the data updates to reflect this change.
